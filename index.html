<p align="center"><font color="#282727" size="9">Not much to say about me (At the moment). I'm an engineering student who likes video games. My personality traits are being calm and listening to people closely. In my future I wish to be a game designer or at the very least be the designer of 1 game. I don't have any plans other than making plans as I go. I do not update any of my social media accounts and you could find me by searching for my name on Google, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bartu.merkan"><p align="center">but here is the link for my facebook which I haven't used for years.</p></a>
